Creating, Updating and removing of PATH environment variable

One of the simplest way to add path to PATH variable is by exporting it in command line by:

export PATH=/path/to/add

this sets new path. But remember that only in current terminal session. To add to the front or the end of currently
existing path use:

export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/add or export PATH=/path/to/add:$PATH

To check out PATH settings type:

echo $PATH

Profiles

Everytime, when new Terminal session is started, setting of environmental variables is needed. These profile files may be located 
in following locations:

/etc/.bashrc
/etc/profile
~/.bashrc
~/.bash_profile
~/.profile
~/.MacOSX/environment.plist

Parts from which PATH is assembled

PATH parts are stored in:

/etc/paths
/etc/paths.d
/etc/manpaths
/etc/manpaths.d

and for current User also in

~/.MacOSX/environment.plist
